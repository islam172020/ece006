<h3>History of mobile phones</h3>
<p>With Apple launching its tenth-generation iPhone, we have to go back to the 1970s, to understand the history of mobile phones, which in a short time managed to change our lives forever.

The idea of mobile phones started a long time ago, but the real beginning was in 1973, when the American Motorola company presented its phone, "Dainatac", which it did not start manufacturing until after more than 10 years.

During the following years, several cell phones emerged from different companies, but the most important development was the one that came with the "Motorola Startak" phone in 1996, when it was the beginning of phones with a small size.

The device that achieved great success was the Nokia 1100, which was launched by the Finnish company in 2002, which achieved the highest sales in history, despite the simplicity of its design.

Two years later, Motorola introduced the Riser device, which is the last of its kind to feature a cover, which in turn became fashionable due to its slimness and aesthetics, but it was the first to have a mini USB port for charging and music.

The year 2007 witnessed the launch of two revolutionary devices, for example, an amazing development in the smart phone industry, the first is the "BlackBerry Curve" device and it had a full keyboard in addition to an index and a front camera.

The second is the Apple iPhone, which can be said to be the most important development in the world of smartphones and in the last decade.

As for the first Android device, it was in 2008, and it was launched by HTC, but Apple's biggest competitor, Samsung Galaxy, did not release its first version until 2009.
